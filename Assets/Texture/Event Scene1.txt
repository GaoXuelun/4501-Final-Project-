At noon, the hero arrived at the palace to pay respects to the king.
Hero:Your Majesty, the troops have been assembled and are ready to set off at any time.
King:Recently, monsters have been rampant in the surrounding area, causing a large number of people to go missing. You must eradicate these monsters completely.
Hero:Yes, Your Majesty, but I have some doubts...
Before the hero could finish speaking, the king gave his command.
King:Don't ask any more questions, all you need to do now is to follow my orders. It's time for you to set off, and I wish you a triumphant return.
Hero:Yes, Your Majesty.
Although full of doubts, the hero still led the troops to set out.
